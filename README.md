## What value to insert when asked to select a task
If you are asked to provide a task to complete an operation, you can select one by inserting the number of the task with the 'task' keyword in front of it
_Example:_ I want to check of my task that is 3rd on my list. When asked for it I type 'task3'.

## What value to insert when asked to select a subtask
If you are asked to provide a subtask to complete an operation, you can select one by inserting the number of the subtask inside a task.
_Example:_ I want to check off my subtask that is 1st inside the task. When asked for it I type '1'.

When asked to insert a due date, you can insert it in any format. We can't limit the format, because it would be too restrictive.
